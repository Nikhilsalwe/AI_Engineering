# IceBreaker Project

This project uses LangChain for building an ice breaker application.

## Project Setup

### Environment Setup
- Python version: 3.12
- Using `pipenv` for dependency management

### Dependencies
- langchain

### Getting Started

1. Install pipenv if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
pipenv shell
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pipenv install
```

This will create a `Pipfile.lock` file that locks your dependency versions.

### Project Structure
- `ice_breaker.py` - Main application file
- `Pipfile` - Dependency management configuration
- `Pipfile.lock` - Locked dependencies (created after running `pipenv install`)

## Development Notes
- The project is configured to use Python 3.12
- Dependencies are managed using `pipenv` for better reproducibility
- Main module is set up in `ice_breaker.py`
