Line-by-Line Explanation of ReAct Agent with LangGraph

======================================================
Think of this code as building a "robot helper" (Agent) that can do reasoning, 
decide if it needs tools, use tools, and then answer questions. We'll walk through 
the three files step by step.

------------------------------------------------------
main.py - Graph Configuration and Execution
------------------------------------------------------
1. from dotenv import load_dotenv
   - Loads secret keys (like Google API keys) from a .env file.

2. from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
   - Lets us create human messages like: "What is the temperature in Tokyo?"

3. from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, END
   - MessagesState: A box that holds all the conversation messages.
   - StateGraph: A flowchart builder where we design how the robot thinks.
   - END: A signal that says "we are done".

4. from nodes import run_agent_reasoning, tool_node
   - Imports custom logic: one for reasoning (thinking) and one for tools.

5. should_continue(state: MessagesState)
   - Checks if the last message asked for a tool (like search or triple).
   - If NO tool is needed → go to END.
   - If a tool IS needed → go to ACT (tool step).

6. flow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
   - Start building our flowchart with messages as state.

7. flow.add_node(AGENT_REASON, run_agent_reasoning)
   - Add a thinking step called "agent_reason".

8. flow.set_entry_point(AGENT_REASON)
   - First step is always reasoning.

9. flow.add_node(ACT, tool_node)
   - Add a step where tools get called.

10. flow.add_conditional_edges(AGENT_REASON, should_continue, { END: END, ACT: ACT })
    - After reasoning, check if tools are needed. Jump accordingly.

11. flow.add_edge(ACT, AGENT_REASON)
    - After tools are used, go back to reasoning (to reflect on results).

12. app = flow.compile()
    - Compile the flowchart into a runnable app.

13. app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(output_file_path="flow.png")
    - Draws the flowchart into a PNG file called flow.png.

14. if __name__ == "__main__":
       res = app.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="What is the temperature in Tokyo? List it and then triple it")]})
       print(res["messages"][-1].content)
    - Actually run the app with a test question.
    - Output the final answer after reasoning and tool usage.

------------------------------------------------------
nodes.py - Agent Reasoning and Tools Setup
------------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are a helpful assistant..."
   - A set of instructions that guides how the robot should behave.

2. def run_agent_reasoning(state: MessagesState) -> MessagesState:
   - Sends system message + human messages to the LLM (Gemini).
   - LLM replies with reasoning (maybe asking for a tool call).

3. tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
   - Special LangGraph node that knows how to call actual tools (search, triple).

------------------------------------------------------
react.py - Defining Tools and LLM
------------------------------------------------------
1. @tool def triple(num: float) -> float:
   - A tool that takes a number and returns num * 3.

2. tools = [TavilySearch(max_results=3), triple]
   - Two tools available: online search + triple number.

3. llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(...).bind_tools(tools)
   - Connect Gemini LLM with the tools so it can call them when needed.

------------------------------------------------------
How Execution Works (Step by Step)
------------------------------------------------------
1. User asks: "What is the temperature in Tokyo? List it and then triple it".

2. Flow starts at AGENT_REASON → run_agent_reasoning
   - LLM thinks: "I need to search for Tokyo temperature".
   - It requests the search tool.

3. should_continue sees tool request → go to ACT.

4. ACT (tool_node) runs TavilySearch tool → gets temperature.

5. Flow loops back to AGENT_REASON.
   - LLM thinks again: "Now I need to triple this temperature".
   - It requests the triple tool.

6. ACT runs triple tool → result is returned.

7. Back to AGENT_REASON one last time.
   - LLM composes final answer with reasoning + result.

8. END is reached → final message printed.

------------------------------------------------------
When flow.png is Drawn
------------------------------------------------------
- Right before execution, the flow is compiled and drawn.
- The PNG shows nodes:
   AGENT_REASON → ACT → AGENT_REASON → END
- This matches the waterfall diagram you saw in LangSmith.

======================================================
Simple Analogy:
- AGENT_REASON = Brain thinking what to do.
- ACT = Hands using a tool (like calculator or Google).
- END = Done, give answer.
